Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

sub fib{
    my ($a, $b) = (1,2);
    my $arg = @_[0];
    my $sum = 0;

    while ($b < $arg){
        if ($b % 2 == 0){ $sum += $b; }
        ($a, $b) = ($b, $a+$b);
    }
    return $sum;
}

print("Answer: ", fib(4000000), "\n");
